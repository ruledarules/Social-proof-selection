## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- Completing this project, I started with mobile responsiveness first. I used the lessons I learned from completing a previous project to improve in my use of the CSS.
- I recently learned about utilizing the root of CSS and I will be using that on a regular basis for any and all projects in the future.
-I became very reliant on using the "inspect" feature to help adjust the minor (and some larger) aspects of my project.

### Continued development

I plan on improving how I use the alignment features of Flexbox. It came in handy when setting up the positions for the larger elements of the project.
